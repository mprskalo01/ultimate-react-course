# Components, Instances, and Elements

React relies on **components**, **elements**, and **instances** to build UIs. Here's a quick overview with examples:

## 1. **React Components**

A **component** is a reusable function or class that returns React elements (UI).

### Example: Functional Component

```tsx
function Greeting({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

// Usage
<Greeting name="John" />;
```

## 2. **React Elements**

A **React Element** is a lightweight, immutable JavaScript object describing **what** to render.

### Example: React Element

```tsx
const element = <h1>Welcome!</h1>;
console.log(element);
// Output: { type: "h1", props: { children: "Welcome!" } }
```

## 3. **React Instances**

A **React Instance** refers to the rendered version of a component.

- Functional components: no explicit instance.
- Class components: create instances to manage state/lifecycle.

### Example: Class Component Instance

```tsx
class Greeting extends React.Component<{ name: string }> {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
<Greeting name="John" />; // Instance created internally
```

## Key Differences

| **Aspect**     | **Component**  | **Element**              | **Instance**                  |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Function/class | Immutable UI description | Rendered component            |
| **Usage**      | `<Greeting />` | `<h1>Hello!</h1>`        | Managed by React (class only) |

## Summary

- **Components**: Reusable UI logic.
- **Elements**: What to render.
- **Instances**: How React manages components (class only).

# Understanding React's Render Phase

The render phase is one of the most crucial parts of React's internal workings. Let me break this down comprehensively.

## Core Concept

The render phase is the first of React's two-phase rendering system (Render and Commit). During this phase, React performs all the necessary calculations and comparisons to determine what changes need to be made to the DOM, but importantly, it doesn't actually make any of these changes yet.

## Key Steps in the Render Phase

### 1. Trigger a Render

A render can be triggered in two primary ways:

_Initial Render_: When a component first mounts to the DOM

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

_Re-render_: When a component's state or props change

```javascript
setState({ newValue: 'updated' });
// or
props.onChange('new value');
```

### 2. Component Traversal

React creates or updates its virtual DOM by traversing components recursively. During this traversal:

```javascript
function ParentComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent />
      <AnotherChild />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The process follows these steps:

_For Class Components_:

- Calls the `render()` method
- Evaluates the returned JSX

_For Function Components_:

- Executes the function
- Evaluates the returned JSX
- Processes hooks in their exact order

### 3. Reconciliation

This is where React's "diffing" algorithm comes into play. The reconciler (nicknamed "Fiber" in React 16+) performs several key tasks:

_Element Type Check_:

```javascript
// If these elements have different types, React rebuilds the entire tree
<div> vs <span>
<Button> vs <Input>
```

_Props Comparison_:

```javascript
// React checks if props have changed
<Button color="blue" /> vs <Button color="red" />
```

_Key-Based Reconciliation_:

```javascript
// React uses keys to track list items
items.map((item) => <ListItem key={item.id} />);
```

### 4. Fiber Tree Construction

React builds or updates its Fiber tree, which contains:

- Current tree (representing what's currently on screen)
- Workable tree (representing pending updates)

Each Fiber node contains critical information:

```javascript
{
  type: 'div',
  props: { children: [] },
  return: parentFiber,
  child: firstChild,
  sibling: nextSibling,
  alternate: currentFiber,
  effectTag: 'PLACEMENT',
  // ... more properties
}
```

### 5. Effects Collection

During this phase, React:

- Identifies components that need updating
- Collects side effects (like DOM updates needed)
- Tags nodes with effect types (PLACEMENT, UPDATE, DELETION)

## Performance Considerations

The render phase is "interruptible," meaning React can:

- Pause rendering to handle higher-priority updates
- Resume rendering later from where it left off
- Abandon work if it's no longer needed

This is achieved through scheduling priorities:

```javascript
const priorities = {
  ImmediatePriority: 1,
  UserBlockingPriority: 2,
  NormalPriority: 3,
  LowPriority: 4,
  IdlePriority: 5,
};
```

## Important Notes

1. The render phase is purely computational and doesn't produce visible changes.

2. React may run the render phase multiple times before committing changes.

3. Code in render should be pure and side-effect free:

```javascript
// Bad - Side effect in render
function Component() {
  document.title = 'New Title'; // Don't do this during render
  return <div>Content</div>;
}

// Good - Side effect in useEffect
function Component() {
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = 'New Title';
  }, []);
  return <div>Content</div>;
}
```

Understanding the render phase helps developers write more efficient React applications by:

- Avoiding unnecessary renders
- Implementing proper reconciliation optimization
- Making informed decisions about component structure
- Better understanding how to debug performance issues

This knowledge is particularly valuable when optimizing React applications or implementing advanced patterns like render props or higher-order components.

# Understanding React's Commit Phase

The commit phase is the second and final phase of React's rendering process, where the calculated changes are actually applied to the DOM. Let's explore this crucial phase in detail.

## Core Concept

While the render phase calculates what changes are needed, the commit phase is where React takes those calculations and actually applies them to the DOM. This phase is synchronous and uninterruptible to ensure UI consistency.

## Key Steps in the Commit Phase

### 1. Pre-commit

Before making any DOM changes, React:

_Captures Current State_:

```javascript
// React maintains references to current DOM nodes
const currentDOM = fiber.stateNode;
const parentDOM = fiber.return.stateNode;
```

_Prepares Layout Effects_:

```javascript
// Cleans up previous layout effects
if (current !== null) {
  const prevEffect = current.effectTag;
  if (prevEffect & LayoutEffect) {
    // Clean up previous layout effects
  }
}
```

### 2. DOM Mutations

React processes the effect list created during the render phase, applying changes in this order:

```javascript
// Pseudo-code of effect processing
function commitRoot(root) {
  // 1. Handle deletions first
  commitDeletion(deletion);

  // 2. Handle placements (insertions)
  commitPlacement(placement);

  // 3. Handle updates
  commitWork(update);
}
```

_Types of Mutations_:

1. _Host Component Updates_:

```javascript
// Direct DOM manipulation
node.setAttribute('class', 'new-class');
node.style.color = 'blue';
node.textContent = 'Updated text';
```

2. _Component Mounting_:

```javascript
// Creating new DOM nodes
const newNode = document.createElement('div');
parent.appendChild(newNode);
```

3. _Component Unmounting_:

```javascript
// Removing DOM nodes
parent.removeChild(node);
```

### 3. Lifecycle Methods and Hooks

React executes various lifecycle methods and hooks in a specific order:

_Class Components_:

```javascript
class Component extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Called after DOM mutations
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // Called after update mutations
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Called before removal
  }
}
```

_Function Components_:

```javascript
function Component() {
  // Layout Effects run synchronously after mutations
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    // DOM measurements and mutations
    return () => {
      // Cleanup
    };
  });

  // Effects run asynchronously after render
  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effects
    return () => {
      // Cleanup
    };
  });
}
```

### 4. Effect Execution

React handles effects in two phases:

_Layout Effects_:

- Run synchronously immediately after DOM mutations
- Used for DOM measurements and synchronous DOM mutations

_Passive Effects_:

- Run asynchronously after the commit completes
- Used for side effects like data fetching, subscriptions

```javascript
// Execution order
commitRoot() {
  // 1. DOM Mutations
  commitMutationEffects();

  // 2. Layout Effects
  commitLayoutEffects();

  // 3. Schedule Passive Effects
  schedulePassiveEffects();
}
```

## Important Characteristics

### 1. Synchronous Nature

```javascript
// The commit phase runs synchronously to maintain UI consistency
function commitRoot(root) {
  // Cannot be interrupted once started
  flushSync(() => {
    commitRootImpl(root);
  });
}
```

### 2. Guaranteed DOM Updates

Unlike the render phase, every commit phase results in actual DOM updates:

```javascript
// Each of these will trigger a commit
setState(newState); // State updates
forceUpdate(); // Force re-renders
ReactDOM.render(element); // Initial renders
```

### 3. Performance Implications

The commit phase impacts performance because:

- It runs on the main thread
- Cannot be interrupted
- Directly manipulates the DOM

Best practices include:

```javascript
// Minimize DOM mutations
const Component = memo(({ text }) => {
  return <div>{text}</div>;
});

// Use transitions for non-urgent updates
startTransition(() => {
  setCount((c) => c + 1);
});
```

## Developer Considerations

1. Keep commit phase work minimal by:

   - Avoiding heavy computations in lifecycle methods
   - Using `useLayoutEffect` sparingly
   - Minimizing DOM manipulations

2. Handle measurements and mutations appropriately:

```javascript
// Use useLayoutEffect for DOM measurements
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  const measurements = element.getBoundingClientRect();
  // Update DOM based on measurements
}, []);
```

3. Properly cleanup effects:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = subscribe();
  return () => {
    // Cleanup before next commit
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
}, []);
```

Understanding the commit phase is crucial for:

- Debugging rendering issues
- Optimizing performance
- Managing side effects appropriately
- Implementing complex animations
- Handling DOM measurements correctly

This knowledge helps developers create more performant and predictable React applications.

# How Events Work in React

- Event Bubbling - Events bubble up through parent elements
- Event Delegation - Single handler manages events on multiple children
- Event Capturing - Events captured from parent down before bubbling
- Synthetic Events - React's cross-browser wrapper around native events
